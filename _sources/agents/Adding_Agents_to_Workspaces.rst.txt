Adding Agents to Workspaces
===========================

**Quick Steps to Connect an Agent to Your Workspace:**

**Step 1:** Connect to Your Workspace

   Begin by establishing a connection to the workspace. Do this by typing the command:

   .. code-block:: none

      /workspace connect <workspace_id>

   Replace ``<workspace_id>`` with the actual ID of the workspace you want to connect to.

**Step 2:** Add an Agent

   Once connected, you can add an agent to this workspace. Simply enter:

   .. code-block:: none

      /add <agent_id>

   Replace ``<agent_id>`` with the ID of the agent you wish to add.

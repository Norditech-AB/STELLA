Sending and Receiving Messages in Chat
======================================

This section outlines the process of sending and receiving messages within a chat object, utilizing the SocketIO library for real-time communication.

Sending Messages
----------------

To send a message in the chat, the following steps are executed:

1. **Connection Verification:**
   The system checks if there is an active connection to a chat or workspace. If not connected, an error message is displayed.

2. **Response Wait Check:**
   If the system is waiting for a response from a previous message, it prevents sending another message to avoid overlap.

3. **Chat ID Determination:**
   If a chat ID is not explicitly provided, the one from the current session is used.

4. **Authorization String Retrieval:**
   A request is made to obtain a message authorization string. This string is used to authenticate the message.

5. **Message Sending:**
   The message, along with the chat ID and the message authorization string, is sent to the chat object via the SocketIO emit function.

Understanding SocketIO's Emit Function
--------------------------------------

SocketIO's `emit` function plays a crucial role in message transmission:

- **Purpose:** The `emit` function is used to send custom events from the client to the server or vice versa.

- **Usage:** In our chat system, `emit` is used to send messages to the server, where the message data is packaged in a JSON object.

.. note::
   For a deeper understanding of SocketIO's `emit` function and other key concepts, refer to the `SocketIO official documentation <https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Receiving Messages
------------------

Messages are received in real-time, thanks to the SocketIO library's event-driven architecture. When a message is sent to the chat object, it's processed and, if valid, distributed to all connected clients.

1. **Real-Time Communication:**
   SocketIO allows for real-time communication between clients and the server, ensuring that messages are promptly delivered and received.

2. **Event Handling:**
   The chat system listens for message events and handles them accordingly, facilitating interactive communication.

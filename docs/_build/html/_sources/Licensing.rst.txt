Dual-License Model
------------------
STELLA operates under a dual-license model, including an Open-Source license (AGPLv3) and an Enterprise license (Commercial). The Open-Source license is free to use, while the Enterprise license is available for purchase. Both licenses include access to the STELLA package manager (:doc:`cli/Installing_External_Agents`), which provides a wide range of community-developed agents.
When working with STELLA, you can choose the license that best suits your needs.

Open-Source License (AGPL-3.0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AGPL-3.0 License: This license is perfect for students and hobbyists. It's an `Open Source Initiative (OSI)-approved open-source license <https://opensource.org/licenses/>`_ that encourages collaborative development and knowledge exchange. For detailed information, please refer to the LICENSE file.

.. note::
    The AGPL-3.0 license requires that any modifications to the STELLA source code be made publicly available. This means that any modifications to the STELLA source code must be made available to the public, even if the software is not distributed.

Enterprise License
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enterprise License: Tailored for commercial purposes, this license allows for the integration of STELLA software into commercial products and services. This option is ideal for those who need to use our solutions in a commercial context without adhering to the open-source stipulations of the AGPL-3.0 license.
